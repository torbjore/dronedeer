This document presents details about the model results, including convergence diagnostics, posterior predictive checks, tables and figures. The document is written in Quarto, and the source file containing all R code is available in the GitHub-repository accompanying the paper (zip-file provided for per review).

# Organization of the data

All data are in the `data` folder of the repository. The data-files included here are:

-   `SiteData.rda`: The full data from the study sites (excluding enclosure). See `SiteDataInfo.html` for description of the variables.
-   `CountData.rda`: Based on `SiteData.rda`, but includes only counts in a long format.
-   `CountData_Fence.rda`: Counts in a long format from the enclosure.
-   `nimbleData.rda`: Data from the study sites organized for NIMBLE models. File is produced by the script in `data\Make_nimbleData.R`.
-   `nimbleData_Fence.rda`: Data from the enclosure organized for NIMBLE models. File is produced by the script in `data\Make_nimbleData_Fence.R`.

# Enclosures

The enclosure contained a total of 117 red deer in a 5 hectare area. Two surveys (flights) were conducted over the enclosures, one at 40 m above ground and one at 60 meter above ground.
